# PredictiveModellingAzureML
Predictive Modelling for Flight Delay Prediction with Azure Machine Learning Studio

Building Predictive model to predict flight delays using weather data provided by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). 

# Implementation Workflow

1. Introduction and Setup Instructions

2. Importing the Data Sets

3. Scrubbing Missing Values

4. Eliminating Target Leaks

5. Conversion to Categorical Features

6. Preparing Features to be Joined with Weather Data

7. Preprocessing the Weather Dataset

8. Joining Both Datasets

9. Training and Evaluating the Model
